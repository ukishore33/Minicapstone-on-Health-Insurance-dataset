# Analysis of Health Insurance Dataset using Python

The main aim of the Project was to perform Exploratory Data Analysis and Perform cleaning and perform predictions from the Corona Dataset.

Imported various Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib into Google Collab and Readed the corona dataset using read_csv() function and checked for duplicates and null values. 

While observing every column separately, we observed the values which are wrongly typed or in some values in which the values should be dropped, we cleaned the data accordingly.

while performing Exploratory data analysis, we performed univariate analysis, correlation between data using heatmap and listed down the observations accordingly.

While performing Feauture engineering, we performed encoding using label encoder, performed variance inflation factor for checking which variables to be taken for performing machine learning algorithms.

While splitting the data according the vif factors previously checked, we selected the x and y columns accordingly, performed scaling using standard scalar and performed predictions using logistic regression, SVR, random forest, Gradient Booster.

In conclusion the accuracy of Gradient Booster, we get high accuracy. So we use gradient Booster prediction for data Deployment.
